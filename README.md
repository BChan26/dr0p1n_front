# DR0P1N

## CONCEPT

DR0P1N is a web app that enables Richmond area skaters to find and share skate spots with the local skateboarding community and those visiting from out of town.

### FUNCTIONALITY

Upon registering an account, the user should be able to browse local spots, update information about these spots, create new spots, comment on spots, and DR0P1N to spots.

#### WHATS A DR0P1N?

DR0P1Ns are similar to the concept of Check-Ins in the old Four Square app. The general idea is that users can arrive at a spot and DR0P1N on the app to let other users know where they're skating.

It also serves the function of letting people from out of town know what spots are popular and active. 

Lastly it could be a good indicator for skateboarders who want to avoid spots that are currently crowded.

### MVP GOALS

1. User registration and log-in for protected routes.
2. An interactive map with geo-markers representing local skatespots.
3. Mapping card elements of local spots
4. A spot detail view where users can get more information about a spot, read and post comments, update spot information, and DR0P1N.

### STRETCH

1. Adding events to spots (meetups, skate competitions, clean-ups, volunteering, etc)
2. Friends lists, leaderboards for regular DROPINs
3. User settings/panel to change username, password, upload profile picture, etc.
